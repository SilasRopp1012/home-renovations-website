Kevin Frazier provided creative ideas, detailed estimates and billing statements, as well as diligent oversight of every project. Most importantly, Kevin maintained effective communication during each step of the living room, porch & deck, kitchen, powder room, master bathroom and garage projects. Chris Frazier provided creative ideas and excellent craftsmanship in the building of our custom cabinets for the interior rooms mentioned above. We were continually amazed at the way he could take an idea from a picture and build it to our specifications. We have a beautiful 'Total House Makeover' because of the high standards of workmanship that Horizon Renovations routinely delivers. On a grading scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest score, we would give Kevin and the entire Horizon Renovation team a '10' for their workmanship, integrity, dependability, professionalism and trustworthiness."

Many people within the Governors Club struggle to find competent people to do repairs/modernization work to the interior and exterior of their homes. However, there are many horror stories resulting from contractors who have not provided what was agreed, or quality and timeliness was not up to acceptable standards. Fortunately, my experience was just the opposite, no horror, just quality work which resulted in a satisfied customer. Their work was exemplified by: detailed estimate, always showing up on agreed time, Kevin easily accessible to discuss ongoing work, skilled workforce who are employees not sub-contractors, worksite cleaned each day, quality materials and agreed timeline for job completion. I rarely provide references, but am pleased to recommend you to anyone."

We were very impressed with the professionalism of every Horizon employee and contractor, but especially its owners, Chris and Kevin Frazier. Their communication with us was stellar at every step. The scope of our project took several months of continuous work at our home, but we always knew in advance who was coming and when. We were very pleasantly surprised about how smoothly everything went. Adding to that, and perhaps most important, we had very high-quality renovations that were finished when expected. Chris, who oversaw the on-site work, had the eye of a perfectionist, so all the work met or exceeded our expectations. But now for the real testimonial of their exceptional customer service: We recently encountered a problem with our hot water system that was totally unrelated to anything they had done. After wasting countless hours trying to solve the problem with other companies, we called Horizon to see if they could give us information. Kevin responded immediately and Chris came out to diagnose the problem shortly after. They had us fixed up and working in no time, and to do it they took time out of their busy construction schedule to help a previous customer."

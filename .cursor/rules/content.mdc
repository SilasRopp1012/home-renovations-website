Purpose:
Ensure all website text content is managed in one place for consistency, easier updates, and potential localization.

Rule:
All user-facing text (like headings, paragraphs, button labels, and messages) must be defined in the @content.ts file. Other files — including page components and UI elements — must not contain hardcoded or raw text directly. Instead, they should reference content by importing it from content.ts.

What This Includes:

Titles and subtitles

Descriptions and body text

Button or link text

Tooltips, popups, banners, etc.

Photos:
In addition to the content, all photos should be found in the same place as well, and referenced from that file to make editing content as easy as possible

Exceptions:

Developer-focused messages such as console logs or internal debug text

Temporary placeholders during initial development (if clearly marked and documented)

Why This Matters:

Makes content updates easier and safer

Keeps all content organized and searchable

Supports scalability and internationalization

Enforcement:

Review all pull requests to ensure no new raw text is added to page or component files

Refactor any hardcoded content into the central content.ts file
